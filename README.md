# Project-Create-a-Token
The Jcoin smart contract is a simple, lightweight token implementation in Solidity, resembling basic functionalities of an ERC20 token. Designed for educational and experimental purposes, this contract allows an owner to manage the creation (minting) and destruction (burning) of tokens.

Key Features:

Minting: Create new tokens and assign them.
Burning: Remove tokens from circulation.
Balance Tracking: Monitor token balances.
